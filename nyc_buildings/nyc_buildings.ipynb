    "Many plotting libraries can handle collections of polygons, including [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/texas.html) and [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/gallery/demos/bokeh/choropleth_data_link.html). However, because browser-based libraries like Bokeh and Plotly send all the polygon data to JavaScript running in the browser, they can struggle when either the collections or the individual polygons themselves get large. Even natively in Python, typical formats like Shapely for representing polygons scale poorly to large polygon collections, because each polygon is wrapped up as a full, separate Python object, leading to a lot of duplicated storage overhead when many polygons of the same type are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to work with lots of polygons, here you can see how to use [SpatialPandas](https://github.com/holoviz/spatialpandas) and [Dask](https://dask.org) to represent large collections of polygons efficiently in memory, [fastparquet](https://fastparquet.readthedocs.io/) to represent them efficiently on disk, [Datashader](https://datashader.org) to render them quickly in a web browser, and [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) to provide a convenient API. This notebook also demonstrates how to support hovering for datashaded polygons, with HoloViews setting up Bokeh to overlay a single vector-based representation of a polygon where the mouse cursor is, while all the rest are sent to the browser only as rendered pixels. That way hover and other interactive features can be supported fully without ever needing to transfer large amounts of data or store them in the limited memory of the web browser tab.  \n",
